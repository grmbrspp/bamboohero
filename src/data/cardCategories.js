When something is produced to be thrown away, resources are wasted without serving a purpose.<br><br> Second, we should note the following points, when we choose our meals: <ul><li>food should be plant based</li><li>we should choose regional and seasonal products</li><li>and prefer organic food</li></ul> Not only are these recommendations good for the environment, but also for our health."

Currently 80% of the electrical current is generated from fossil sources.
